Over the last mile, she flew until—with half a lap remaining—she found herself ahead of PR pace. Eyes locked on the finish, Goodman surged in the homestretch. The scoreboard showed 32:09.82, a 52-second personal best. Her family screamed from the stands.
Since graduating in 2010 from the University of California-Davis, Goodman waited for a moment like this. In a four-year span, she alternated solid months of training with doubts about whether professional running was a realistic dream, given her PR of 33:01 for 10,000 meters. Full-time work beckoned.
But Goodman didn’t give up. She took a big leap. She trained for a marathon for the first time. Suddenly she was running more miles than ever, and on top of that, building workouts inside her long runs. This was uncharted territory, but the payoff was huge. Heading into the track season, she felt stronger than ever.</p>
